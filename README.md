# 🧾 User Info Fetcher
This project is a simple web application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It demonstrates how to fetch data from a public API and display it dynamically on a web page.
The app shows a list of users with their names, email addresses, and city, and it includes a "Reload" button to fetch the data again whenever needed.

## 📌 Project Overview

This mini-project was created to:

- Practice how to fetch data using the `fetch()` method in JavaScript.
- Learn how to work with **JSON data** returned from APIs.
- Understand how to use **DOM manipulation** to display data.
- Handle **errors** when a request fails.
- Style data display cards using basic **CSS**.
- Make a real-world style component using a **public API**.
